# Better Medieval Total War Camera (Steam edition)
Improve camera height limits and tilt for the original Medieval Total War game. This has only been tested on the Steam edition.

Install cheat engine, load the included file, link with the game exe, tweak the settings how you want them. Once you have the settings how you like them, you can set and lock them in the main menu and the camera will be unlocked for the entire session.

There is also a version for Shogun Total War in my repo.
